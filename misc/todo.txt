- getGapCols in poly time. 
- compress hashes.
- paxos doDense *only* iterates over used columns, as opposed to all of them.
- baxos par solve, remove vector -> std::vector<block> hashes_(mNumItems);
- optimize/minimize threadBinSize

- on decode, allow unordered output?

- Research question: fewer AES rounds if we only want the first bit to be random? maybe the XOR of the bits?
